# Learning Folder

This folder captures insights, knowledge gained, and lessons learned.

## How It Works

- Learning is organized by topic and connected to your goals
- AI helps reinforce learning through spaced repetition suggestions
- Insights are linked to practical applications and future opportunities

## Folder Contents
- Key insights and "aha moments"

*Knowledge becomes wisdom when it's applied and shared.*
