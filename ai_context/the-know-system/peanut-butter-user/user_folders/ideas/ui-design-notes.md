# UI Design Ideas - pB App

**Date**: 2025-08-04  
**Status**: In Development

## Current Tech Stack
- **Components**: Radix UI components (already in use)
- **Metrics/Charts**: Considering Tremor graphs for data visualization
- **File Type**: JSX files
- **Concern**: Tremor compatibility with JSX setup

## UI Component Ideas

### Radix Components (Confirmed)
- Already integrated and working
- Good accessibility and customization
- Solid foundation for the app

### Tremor Integration (To Research)
- **Purpose**: Metrics and data visualization
- **Use Cases**: 
  - User progress tracking charts
  - Learning pattern visualization
  - Goal achievement metrics
  - Personality type distribution graphs
- **Compatibility Question**: How well does Tremor work with JSX files?

## Potential Alternatives to Tremor
- **Recharts**: Popular React charting library
- **Chart.js with React wrapper**: Flexible and well-documented
- **Victory**: Component-based charting for React
- **D3.js**: Maximum customization but more complex

## Integration Research Needed
- Test Tremor with current JSX setup
- Check bundle size impact
- Verify component compatibility with Radix
- Performance testing with real data

## Future UI Considerations
- Mood-responsive interface design
- Personality type-based UI adaptations
- Real-time metric updates
- Mobile responsiveness
- Dark/light theme support

**Next Steps**: Research Tremor + JSX compatibility, test integration, evaluate alternatives if needed.
