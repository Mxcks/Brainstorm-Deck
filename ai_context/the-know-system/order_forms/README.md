## Naming Convention

All order forms follow the naming pattern:
```
{project_description}_PLAN-{YYYYMMDD}-{sequence}.yaml
```

Where:
- `project_description`: Brief description of the project
- `YYYYMMDD`: Date of creation
- `sequence`: Sequential number for that day (0001, 0002, etc.)

## Template Integration

Each order form demonstrates integration with templates from the `templates/imported_templates/` directory:
- **Systems Thinking Framework** - For complex system analysis
- **Value Equation Template** - For optimization and efficiency
- **Feynman Learning Template** - For learning-based approaches
- **And more** - Various frameworks for different project types

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Select appropriate category** when creating new order forms
2. **Use consistent naming** following the established pattern
3. **Include template integration** to enhance project clarity
4. **Document template selection reasoning** in the project structure section
5. **Maintain YAML structure** as defined in the master template

## Adding New Categories

To add new project categories:
1. Create new subdirectory in `order_forms/`
2. Update this README with category description
3. Move relevant existing order forms if applicable
4. Update any automation scripts to recognize new category

## Integration with Template System

Order forms in this directory demonstrate how templates from `templates/imported_templates/` enhance project planning by:
- Providing proven methodologies
- Adding systematic approaches
- Ensuring comprehensive coverage
- Improving project success rates

Each category may favor certain template types:
- **Home Organization**: Systems Thinking, Optimization frameworks
- **Productivity**: Value Equation, Efficiency templates
- **Web Development**: Technical frameworks, Project templates
- **Personal Development**: Learning frameworks, Habit formation
- **Example Projects**: Various templates for demonstration
