# Action Sequence

## Purpose
Map the specific steps that must happen and in what order, including current project location.

## Core Question
**"What specific steps must happen and in what order?"**

## Minimum Components

Every action sequence requires:

1. **Step Definition**: What specific actions must be taken
2. **Sequence Order**: Dependencies and logical flow
3. **Project Location**: Where you currently are in the sequence
4. **Decision Points**: Where choices affect the path forward

## Structure
- `/system-defaults/` - Standard sequencing frameworks
- `/user-templates/` - User's custom sequence approaches
- `/project-instances/` - Specific project sequences
- `transfer-rules.md` - What carries over between projects/templates
