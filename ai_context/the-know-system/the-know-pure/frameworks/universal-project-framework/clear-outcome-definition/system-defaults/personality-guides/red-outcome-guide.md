# Red (Results-Oriented) Outcome Definition Guide

## Approach
Fast, direct, results-focused outcome definition. Emphasize measurable deliverables and clear success metrics.

## Key Questions for Red Types

### 1. Bottom Line Focus
- "What's the end result you need?"
- "What specific deliverable will exist?"
- "How will you measure success?"

### 2. Efficiency Emphasis
- "What's the fastest path to completion?"
- "What's the minimum viable outcome?"
- "What would make this a clear win?"

### 3. Action-Oriented Language
- Use active verbs: "Create," "Build," "Deliver," "Achieve"
- Focus on outcomes, not processes
- Emphasize speed and efficiency

## Red-Specific Template Modifications

### Target State Description
- Lead with the main deliverable
- Use bullet points for quick scanning
- Include quantity/quality metrics upfront

### Success Criteria
- Must be measurable and binary (pass/fail)
- Include time-based metrics
- Focus on business/personal impact

### Scope Boundaries
- Be explicit about what's NOT included
- Prevent scope creep with clear limits
- Focus on core value delivery
