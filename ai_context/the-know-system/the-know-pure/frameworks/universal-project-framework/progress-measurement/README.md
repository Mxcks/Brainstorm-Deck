# Progress Measurement

## Purpose
Track movement and momentum toward project completion.

## Core Question
**"How will you know you're moving toward completion?"**

## Minimum Components

Every progress measurement system requires:

1. **Progress Indicators**: Measurable signals of forward movement
2. **Milestone Definition**: Key checkpoints along the way
3. **Momentum Tracking**: Rate and quality of progress
4. **Course Correction Triggers**: When to adjust approach

## Structure
- `/system-defaults/` - Standard measurement frameworks
- `/user-templates/` - User's custom measurement approaches
- `/project-instances/` - Specific project measurements
- `transfer-rules.md` - What carries over between projects/templates
