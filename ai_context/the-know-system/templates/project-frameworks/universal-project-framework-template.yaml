framework_philosophy:
  core_principle: "The best part is no part. The best process is no process. It weighs nothing, costs nothing, can't go wrong."
  methodology: "Break down any project to its simplest, most fundamental forms"
  approach: "Question every assumption and eliminate unnecessary elements until only the essential remains"
  outcome: "Universal framework that works for any project regardless of size or type"
