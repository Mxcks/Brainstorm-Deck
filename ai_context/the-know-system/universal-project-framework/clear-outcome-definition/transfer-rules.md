# Clear Outcome Definition - Transfer Rules

## What Transfers FROM Projects TO User Templates

### Successful Outcome Patterns
- Outcome definition structures that worked well
- Effective success criteria formats
- Proven stakeholder identification methods
- Scope boundary techniques that prevented scope creep

### Refined Question Sets
- Questions that helped clarify vague outcomes
- Personality-specific approaches that resonated
- Stakeholder analysis methods that uncovered hidden users

### Language and Phrasing
- Effective completion statements
- Clear, measurable criteria language
- Scope boundary phrasing that worked

## What Stays IN Project Instances Only

### Project-Specific Details
- Actual project names and descriptions
- Specific stakeholder names and contact information
- Particular deadlines and timelines
- Individual project context and background

### Personal Notes and Context
- Why this project matters to the user
- Personal motivations and drivers
- Individual learning and insights
- Project-specific challenges and solutions

### Unique Circumstances
- One-off requirements or constraints
- Specific technical or resource limitations
- Individual stakeholder quirks or preferences

## What Inherits FROM System Defaults

### Base Templates
- Standard outcome definition structure
- Core question frameworks
- Basic completion statement formats

### Personality Guides
- Personality-specific question sets
- Communication style adaptations
- Approach methodologies for each type

### Process Frameworks
- Standard outcome definition process
- Common pitfall warnings
- Best practice guidelines

## What NEVER Transfers

### System Integrity
- System default templates cannot be modified by user projects
- Core personality guides remain unchanged
- Base process frameworks stay consistent

### Project Isolation
- One project's outcome definition doesn't affect others
- Project instances remain independent
- Personal context stays project-specific

### Template Boundaries
- User templates don't override system defaults
- System defaults don't get contaminated by user customizations
- Clear separation between system and user content

## Transfer Process

### From Project to User Template
1. User completes project successfully
2. AI identifies effective patterns and approaches
3. User chooses to save as template
4. System extracts generalizable elements
5. Personal/project-specific details are stripped
6. Template is saved to user-templates folder

### From System to User Instance
1. User starts new project
2. System provides default templates and guides
3. User customizes for their specific needs
4. Customizations stay in project instance
5. System defaults remain unchanged

## UI Indicators

The interface should clearly show:
- **System Default** (blue) - Cannot be modified
- **User Template** (green) - User-created and editable
- **Project Instance** (yellow) - Specific to this project
- **Transfer Available** (orange) - Can be saved as template
