# Resource Identification

## Purpose
Catalog all materials, skills, time, and tools needed to complete the project.

## Core Question
**"What materials, skills, time, or tools are needed?"**

## Minimum Components

Every resource identification requires:

1. **Material Resources**: Physical items, software, services needed
2. **Human Resources**: Skills, expertise, people required
3. **Time Resources**: Duration, deadlines, scheduling constraints
4. **Financial Resources**: Budget, costs, funding requirements

## Structure
- `/system-defaults/` - Standard resource frameworks
- `/user-templates/` - User's custom resource approaches
- `/project-instances/` - Specific project resources
- `transfer-rules.md` - What carries over between projects/templates
