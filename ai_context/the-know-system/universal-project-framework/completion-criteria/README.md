# Completion Criteria

## Purpose
Define how you will definitively know the project is finished.

## Core Question
**"How will you definitively know the project is finished?"**

## Minimum Components

Every completion criteria set requires:

1. **Finish Line Definition**: Clear, binary completion markers
2. **Quality Standards**: What "good enough" means
3. **Acceptance Criteria**: Who decides it's complete and how
4. **Handoff Requirements**: What needs to happen for project closure

## Structure
- `/system-defaults/` - Standard completion frameworks
- `/user-templates/` - User's custom completion approaches
- `/project-instances/` - Specific project completion criteria
- `transfer-rules.md` - What carries over between projects/templates
