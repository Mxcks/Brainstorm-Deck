# Brainstorm Projects - Output Delivery

This folder contains the final deliverables and structured outputs from the brainstorming workflow system.

## System Role: OUTPUT Layer
The Brainstorm Projects serves as the delivery mechanism that:
- **Receives processed outputs** from the Brainstorm Deck
- **Organizes project structures** with all necessary components
- **Maintains implementation-ready** deliverables
- **Preserves processing history** and source traceability
- **Provides deployment-ready** project packages

## Directory Structure
```
brainstorm-projects/
├── [project-name]/        # Individual project deliverables
├── templates/            # Project structure templates
├── archives/             # Completed project archives
├── shared-resources/     # Common project assets
└── delivery-logs/        # Processing and delivery history
```

## Project Delivery Structure
Each delivered project follows this enhanced structure:
```
project-name/
├── docs/
│   ├── brainstorm-original.md    # Source brainstorm (preserved)
│   ├── processing-log.md         # Deck processing history
│   ├── requirements.md           # Generated requirements
│   ├── architecture.md           # System architecture
│   └── implementation-guide.md   # Development guidance
├── src/                          # Generated source structure
├── tests/                        # Test frameworks and templates
├── assets/                       # Project resources
├── configs/                      # Configuration files
├── deployment/                   # Deployment configurations
├── README.md                     # Project overview
└── project-metadata.json        # Processing metadata
```

## Delivery Workflows
Projects are delivered through automated workflows from the Deck:

### Standard Delivery
- Structure generation from templates
- Documentation compilation
- Resource organization
- Metadata creation

### Enhanced Delivery
- Code scaffolding generation
- Test framework setup
- Deployment configuration
- Integration templates
