# Brainstorming Guidelines

## Best Practices

### Brainstorm Deck Usage
1. **One idea per file** - Keep brainstorms focused and manageable
2. **Use descriptive names** - Make files easy to find later
3. **Date your brainstorms** - Track when ideas were captured
4. **Don't edit after moving** - Preserve original thinking

### Moving to Projects
1. **Copy, don't move** - Keep original brainstorm intact
2. **Create dedicated folder** - Each project gets its own space
3. **Include original brainstorm** - Reference in project docs
4. **Update status** - Mark brainstorm as "Moved to Project"

### File Naming Conventions
- Brainstorms: `YYYY-MM-DD-project-name-brainstorm.md`
- Projects: Use clear, descriptive folder names
- Templates: Keep in `/brainstorm-structure/templates/`

### Status Tracking
- **Brainstorming** - Initial idea capture
- **Developing** - Actively working on in brainstorm deck
- **Ready to Move** - Brainstorm is complete, ready for project development
- **Moved to Project** - Copied to project folder
- **On Hold** - Paused or waiting
- **Completed** - Project finished
- **Archived** - No longer active

## Folder Organization

### Brainstorm Deck
- Keep active brainstorms here
- Organize by date or topic if needed
- Use subfolders sparingly

### Brainstorm Projects
- One folder per project
- Use consistent structure (see template)
- Include original brainstorm in docs/

### Brainstorm Structure
- Don't modify frequently
- Add new templates as needed
- Keep guidelines updated
