# Workflow Connections & Data Flow

This document defines how the three system layers connect and interact to create a seamless brainstorming-to-project workflow.

## Connection Architecture

### ðŸ”— Structure â†’ Deck Connections

#### Tool Invocation
```
brainstorm-structure/tools/[tool] â†’ brainstorm-deck/workflows/[workflow]
```
- Tools are invoked from the Deck using standardized interfaces
- Configuration loaded from Structure configs
- Results processed in Deck environment

#### Template Application
```
brainstorm-structure/templates/ â†’ brainstorm-deck/staging/
```
- Templates copied to staging area for customization
- Deck applies data and transformations
- Customized templates prepared for output

#### Configuration Loading
```
brainstorm-structure/configs/ â†’ brainstorm-deck/active-sessions/
```
- System configurations loaded at session start
- Workflow parameters applied during processing
- Tool settings configured for execution

### ðŸ”— Deck â†’ Projects Connections

#### Output Delivery
```
brainstorm-deck/outputs/ â†’ brainstorm-projects/[project-name]/
```
- Processed results formatted for project delivery
- Project structures created based on templates
- Documentation and resources organized

#### Project Initialization
```
brainstorm-deck/workflows/project-creator â†’ brainstorm-projects/[new-project]/
```
- New project folders created automatically
- Standard project structure applied
- Initial documentation generated

#### Archive Management
```
brainstorm-deck/completed/ â†’ brainstorm-projects/archives/
```
- Completed processing sessions archived
- Project history maintained
- Audit trail preserved

## Data Flow Patterns

### Pattern 1: Simple Tool Execution
```
1. Load tool from Structure/tools/
2. Execute in Deck/active-sessions/
3. Output to Projects/[project]/
```

### Pattern 2: Multi-Stage Processing
```
1. Load workflow from Structure/configs/
2. Execute stages in Deck/workflows/
3. Intermediate results in Deck/staging/
4. Final output to Projects/[project]/
```

### Pattern 3: Template-Based Generation
```
1. Select template from Structure/templates/
2. Customize in Deck/staging/
3. Apply data transformations
4. Generate project structure in Projects/
```

## Interface Specifications

### Tool Interface
```json
{
  "tool_id": "unique-tool-identifier",
  "input_schema": {
    "config_path": "path/to/config",
    "data_path": "path/to/input/data",
    "parameters": {}
  },
  "output_schema": {
    "result_path": "path/to/output",
    "status": "success|error|warning",
    "metadata": {}
  }
}
```

### Workflow Interface
```json
{
  "workflow_id": "unique-workflow-identifier",
  "stages": [
    {
      "stage_name": "stage-identifier",
      "tool": "tool-to-execute",
      "input": "input-specification",
      "output": "output-specification"
    }
  ],
  "final_output": "project-delivery-specification"
}
```

### Project Output Interface
```json
{
  "project_name": "generated-project-name",
  "structure": {
    "folders": ["list", "of", "folders"],
    "files": ["list", "of", "files"]
  },
  "metadata": {
    "source_brainstorm": "original-brainstorm-reference",
    "processing_date": "timestamp",
    "tools_used": ["list", "of", "tools"]
  }
}
```

## Connection Management

### Session Management
- Each processing session gets unique identifier
- Session state tracked across all three layers
- Session cleanup and archival automated

### Error Handling
- Errors propagated across layer boundaries
- Rollback mechanisms for failed processing
- Error logs maintained for debugging

### Performance Optimization
- Caching of frequently used tools and templates
- Parallel processing where possible
- Resource cleanup after processing completion

## Monitoring and Logging

### Connection Monitoring
- Track data flow between layers
- Monitor tool execution performance
- Identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities

### Audit Trail
- Complete record of processing steps
- Source tracking from input to output
- Change history for all transformations

### Health Checks
- Verify connection integrity
- Validate tool availability
- Check output quality and completeness

## Extension Points

### Adding New Connections
1. Define interface specification
2. Implement connection logic
3. Add monitoring and logging
4. Create documentation and tests

### Custom Workflows
1. Define workflow in Structure/configs/
2. Implement stages in Deck/workflows/
3. Specify output format for Projects/
4. Test end-to-end functionality

### Integration Hooks
- Pre-processing hooks for data validation
- Mid-processing hooks for quality checks
- Post-processing hooks for output validation
- Error handling hooks for recovery

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
- Real-time connection monitoring
- Automated workflow optimization
- Advanced error recovery mechanisms
- Performance analytics and reporting

### Scalability Considerations
- Distributed processing capabilities
- Load balancing across tools
- Resource pooling and management
- Horizontal scaling support
