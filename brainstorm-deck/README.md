# Brainstorm Deck - Processing Environment

This is the active processing workspace where tools from the Structure are executed and information is transformed into project-ready outputs.

## System Role: PROCESS Layer
The Brainstorm Deck serves as the processing engine that:
- **Executes tools** from the Brainstorm Structure backend
- **Transforms raw ideas** into structured, actionable information
- **Orchestrates workflows** from input to output
- **Manages active sessions** and processing states
- **Prepares deliverables** for the Brainstorm Projects

## Current Processing Sessions
*Track your active processing workflows here*

- [ ] No active sessions yet

## Available Workflows
*Workflows that connect Structure tools to Project outputs*

### Basic Workflows
- **Brainstorm-to-Project**: Transform brainstorm into project structure
- **Template-to-Implementation**: Apply templates with custom data
- **Analysis-to-Documentation**: Generate docs from analysis results

### Advanced Workflows
- **Multi-Stage Processing**: Complex transformations with multiple tools
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple brainstorms simultaneously
- **Quality Assurance**: Validation and verification workflows

## Tool Execution Environment
Tools from `/brainstorm-structure/tools/` are executed here with:
- Configuration loading from Structure
- Data processing in controlled environment
- Output formatting for Projects delivery
- Error handling and logging
